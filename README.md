# MCFlight
MCFlight is a forge mod written by thepowderguy that is a (somewhat) realistic flight simulator.

## Airplanes:
Airplanes can be placed on the ground and ridden by clicking on them. They will explode if they hit the ground or any object at more than 36 km/h. They have an inventory that can be accessed by shift clicking on them. Placing items in the inventory will change the total weight of the aircraft. A more full inventory means the aircraft will weigh more than it does empty. The difference in weight will affect its behavior in flight.

## Airplane Controls:
Airplanes can be controlled with either a mouse, or keyboard. The mod automatically switches between the two. If using a mouse, the mouse controls alierons and elevators. J and L controls rudder, Up and Down controls the elevators, and Left and Right controls alierons.

## Keyboard Controls:
I: Throttle up  
K: Throttle down  
J/L: Rudder  
Left/Right: Alierons  
Up/Down: Elevators  
Z: Brake  
Space: Look around  
+: Zoom in  
-: Zoom out  
F6: Change camera view  
F9: Toggle Airplane Debug  
F10: Toggle show force vectors  
F8: Toggle HUD  

## Items:
**Oil**: Crude oil is a fluid found underground, it is not useful by itself, instead it has to be refined into more useful products.

**Kerosene**: Kerosene is the fuel used for most aircraft. It is made by refining crude oil - smelting it in a furnace. *To refuel an aircraft, click on it while holding a container of kerosene.*

**Aircraft Paint**: Paint that is used to color aircraft. *To paint an aircraft, click on an airplane with paint in hand, then select the part you want to paint.* Wings and fuselage can be painted separately.

## Cameras:
There are many different camera views.

Cockpit: View from inside the cockpit.  
Tail: Looking from the tail of the aircraft  
Follow: Following the aircraft  
Wing (Left & Right): A camera placed at the wing of the aircraft  
Passenger: A view from further in the back of the fuselage.
